# Project nÂ°7: Star Wars Fansite

This Star Wars Fansite was made with React using the API Swapi (https://swapi.co/) to get all the data about Star Wars universe.

## Functional specifications:

### Basic features:

2 pages minimum:
* Homepage display by default all the categories of data about Star Wars, via request to API swapi.
* Search page: the user can search for a character by his ID. Everytime the user types on his keyboard the research is display under the input.

### To go further:

* A page displaying a list of the category's data with buttons previous and next to see the rest of the list. Exemple: On the homepage, John clicks on category "people", he is redirected to the corresponding page and sees a list of 10 names. If he clicks on next button he will see the next 10 names.
* A page displaying all the data about a specific element. Exemple: In our previous exemple, John chooses to click on Luke Skywalker, he is then redirected to the corresponding page and sees all the data about Luke Skywalker.

### My personnal adding features:

* Buttons previous and next are only displayed if needed.
* A counter for the list of category's data indicating the current page and how many pages there are in total.

## Technical specifications:

* Last version of React
* API Swapi
* Request http with or without axios
